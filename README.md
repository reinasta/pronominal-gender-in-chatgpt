I look at the gender of pronouns generated by [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/) in order to establish if there is any (grammatical) gender bias in how coreference resolution works in ChatGPT or in how ChatGPT generates stories about individuals identified through their occupation (e.g. *engineer*, *nurse*, *doctor* etc.). My preliminary conclusion is that ChatGPT exhibits no pronominal gender bias, but one needs to get clear on what bias would amount to when it comes to gender as expressed in natural language.
